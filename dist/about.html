            <h4>My story</h4>
            <p>
              Up until last year I was a top performing medical device rep
              driven to succeed by my competitive nature. I had been in sales my
              whole professional career and got to the point where I no longer
              found it fulfilling.<br /><br />

              I have always looked up to my brother, a senior software engineer,
              for his ability to find passion and challenges in his day to day
              work. After picking his brain I decided to fully commit to
              changing careers and left what was familiar for a career I truly
              wanted.<br /><br />

              The journey started with a 13 week coding bootcamp where I learned
              the basics of web development. After graduating I got engaged,
              bought a house, rescueded a dog named Cooper, motorcycle toured SE
              Asia, and launched a product for a startup I co founded.<br /><br />

              Currently I am focussing 100% of my time on becoming an expert in
              software development and landing my first full-time position.

          What makes me valuable to you
        </h2>
        <div class="bottom-line"></div>
        <p class="lead">
          <!-- All of my UI/UX and design projects are based off of a practiced
              formula to get the result that I am looking for -->

            <h3>Collaboration</h3>
            <p>
              I am able to communicate effectively at all levels inside &
              outside of your organization. This ensures project goal's are
              understood and implemented in an effective manner. As a medical
              device representative I sold solutions to my customer's pain
              points. As a developer I now have the oportunity to build those
              solutions for you and your customers.

            <h3>Ability To Learn</h3>
            <p>
              The ability to learn is one thing but the ability to learn then
              apply those skills is far superior. My portfolio is filled with
              examples of my incremental knowledge being built and applied to
              projects. I will continue this tradition by quickly learning your
              onboarding proceedures and implement them as my best practices.

            <h3>Passion</h3>
            <p>
              Producing great work comes from having strong passion. The move
              from a lucrative sales job to starting in a new industry was not a
              product of necessity. It was driven by my desire to express
              creativity through the code I write and the effect it has on
              people who use it.

            <h3>Putting In The Time</h3>
            <p>
              I wasn't a top 5% sales rep because I was naturally talented at
              sales. I got there by outworking 95% of my collegues every single
              day. My work ethic and persistence is what makes me different. It
              is also what makes me a valueable asset to your organization.
