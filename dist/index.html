              I am able to communicate effectively with all parties involved to
              ensure the project's goal's are understood and implemented in an
              effective manner. As a medical device representative I used to
              sell solutions to my customer's pain points. As a developer I now
              have the oportunity to build those solutions.

              The ability to learn is one thing but the ability to learn then
              apply those skills is far superior. My portfolio is filled with

            <h3>Passion</h3>
            <p>
              I truely love and am facinated by coding. The move from a very
              lucrative sales job to starting at the bottom of the totem pole in
              a new industry was not driven by necessity. It was driven by my
              desire to be expressing my creativity through the code I write and
              the effect it has on people who use it.

            <h3>Putting In The Time</h3>
            <p>
              What I lack in experience I make up for in power of will and
              persistence. I wasn't a top 5% sales rep because I was unnaturally
              talented at sales. I got there by outworking 95% of the other guys
              every single day. My work ethic is what makes me different.
